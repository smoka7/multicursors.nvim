# Multicursor.nvim [WIP]
The Multicursor Plugin for Neovim extends the native Neovim text editing capabilities, providing a more intuitive way to edit repetitive text with multiple cursors. With this plugin, you can easily create and manage multiple cursors, perform simultaneous edits, and execute commands on all cursors at once.

## Requirements

- Neovim >= **0.9.0**

## Installation

Install with your preferred package manager:

```lua
{
    "smoka7/multicursors.nvim",
    event = "VeryLazy",
    opts = {},
    keys = {
            {
                '<Leader>m',
                '<cmd>MCstart<cr>',
                desc = 'Create a selection for word under the cursor',
            },
        },
}
```

## Configuration

```lua
{
    DEBUG_MODE = false,
    create_commands = true, -- create Multicursor user commands
    updatetime = 50, -- selections get updated if this many milliseconds nothing is typed in the insert mode see :help updatetime
}
```

## Usage

## TODOS
- [ ] Move the selection by "ts" nodes (unclear)
- [ ] Move the selection by Vim motions (unclear)
- [ ] Support count + actions
- [ ] Handle overlapping selections (for now we merge them)
- [ ] Completion works, but doesn't clear duplicates
- [ ]  - Create a mod to show to the user
- [x]  - Clear other selections and only keep the main one
- [x] `[` - Go to the next selection
- [x] `]` - Go to the previous selection
- [x] `z` - Align matches by inserting spaces before the first character of each selection
- [ ] `s` - Save matches
- [ ] `S` - Restore matches
- [ ] Should selection movements wrap vertically?
- [ ] Should selection movements wrap horizontally?
- [ ] Should `<bs>` wrap?
- [ ] Should folded lines get ignored when searching?
- [ ] show help window for mapping and registers ?
