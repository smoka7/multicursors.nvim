# Multicursors.nvim
The Multicursor Plugin for Neovim extends the native Neovim text editing capabilities, providing a more intuitive way to edit repetitive text with multiple selections. With this plugin, you can easily create and manage multiple selections, perform simultaneous edits, and execute commands on all selections at once.

# Requirements

- Neovim >= **0.9.0**

# Installation

Install with your preferred package manager:

```lua
-- lazy.nvim:
{
    "smoka7/multicursors.nvim",
    event = "VeryLazy",
    dependencies = {
        'nvimtools/hydra.nvim',
    },
    opts = {},
    cmd = { 'MCstart', 'MCvisual', 'MCclear', 'MCpattern', 'MCvisualPattern', 'MCunderCursor' },
    keys = {
            {
                mode = { 'v', 'n' },
                '<Leader>m',
                '<cmd>MCstart<cr>',
                desc = 'Create a selection for selected text or word under the cursor',
            },
        },
}
```

## Recipes

### Custom mappings

Create custom mapping for editing selections.

```lua
 require('multicursors').setup {
    normal_keys = {
        -- to change default lhs of key mapping change the key
        [','] = {
            -- assigning nil to method exits from multi cursor mode
            -- assigning false to method removes the binding
            method = N.clear_others,
            -- you can pass :map-arguments here
            opts = { desc = 'Clear others' },
        },
        ['<C-/>'] = {
            method = function()
                require('multicursors.utils').call_on_selections(function(selection)
                    vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { selection.row + 1, selection.col + 1 })
                    local line_count = selection.end_row - selection.row + 1
                    vim.cmd('normal ' .. line_count .. 'gcc')
                end)
            end,
            opts = { desc = 'comment selections' },
        },
    },
}
```

### Status Line module

Disable the hint window and show Multicursor mode in your status line.

```lua
 require('multicursors').setup {
    hint_config = false,
}

local function is_active()
    local ok, hydra = pcall(require, 'hydra.statusline')
    return ok and hydra.is_active()
end

local function get_name()
    local ok, hydra = pcall(require, 'hydra.statusline')
    if ok then
        return hydra.get_name()
    end
    return ''
end

--- for lualine add this component
lualine_b = {
    { get_name, cond = is_active },
 }
```

### Vertical hints
A configuration like this can be used to show hints in a vertical window similar to helix.

```lua
 require('multicursors').setup {
    hint_config = {
        float_opts = {
            border = 'rounded',
        },
        position = 'bottom-right',
    },
    generate_hints = {
        normal = true,
        insert = true,
        extend = true,
        config = {
            column_count = 1,
        },
    },
}
```

# Highlight Groups
The following groups are used by `multicursors.nvim` and can be overriden:

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| MultiCursor | Multicursor selections. |
| MultiCursorMain | Main selection in which multicursor began. |
